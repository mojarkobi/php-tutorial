# url matching techniques

```code
regex
^(https?|ftp)://(-\.)?([^\s/?\.#-]+\.?)+(/[^\s]*)?$
```

1. `^`: Anchors the match at the beginning of the string.
2. `(https?|ftp)`: This is a capturing group that matches either "http" or "https" or "ftp". The question mark after "s" makes it optional, allowing for both "http" and "https" to be matched.
3. `://`: Matches the characters `"://"` literally.
4. `(-\.)?`: This is an optional group that matches either "-." or nothing. It's used to allow for subdomains that start with a hyphen.
5. `([^\s/?\.#-]+\.?)+`: This is a capturing group that matches a domain name. It allows for one or more occurrences of a sequence of characters that are not whitespace, "/", ".", "?", "#", or hyphen, followed by an optional period. This allows for multiple subdomains.
6. `(/[^\s]*)?`: This is an optional group that matches a path starting with a "/" followed by zero or more characters that are not whitespace. It allows for a path in the URL.
7. `$`: Anchors the match at the end of the string.

In summary, this regular expression is designed to match strings that represent URLs with "http", "https", or "ftp" protocols, allowing for subdomains and paths. It includes support for subdomains starting with a hyphen and allows for a flexible domain name structure.

## another example

```regex
^(https?|ftp)://(-\.)?([^\s/?\.#-]+\.?)+(/[^\s]*)?$

```

1. `^`: Anchors the match at the beginning of the string.
2. `(https?|ftp)`: This is a capturing group that matches either "http" or "https" or "ftp". The question mark after "s" makes it optional, allowing for both "http" and "https" to be matched. This part represents the protocol in the URL.
3. `://`: Matches the characters `"://"` literally.
4. `(-\.)?`: This is an optional group that matches either "-." or nothing. It's used to allow for subdomains that start with a hyphen.
5. `([^\s/?\.#-]+\.?)+`: This is a capturing group that matches a domain name. It allows for one or more occurrences of a sequence of characters that are not whitespace, "/", ".", "?", "#", or hyphen, followed by an optional period. This allows for multiple subdomains and a top-level domain.
6. `(/[^\s]*)?`: This is an optional group that matches a path starting with a "/" followed by zero or more characters that are not whitespace. It allows for a path in the URL.
7. `$`: Anchors the match at the end of the string.

In summary, this regular expression is designed to match strings that represent URLs with "http", "https", or "ftp" protocols, allowing for subdomains, paths, and flexibility in the structure of the domain name. It is a more elaborate pattern than the previous one and supports a wider range of URL variations.

## youtube url match

Regex: `(?:https?:\\/\\/)?(?:youtu\\.be\\/|(?:www\\.|m\\.)?youtube\\.com\\/(?:watch|v|embed)(?:\\.php)?(?:\\?.\*v=|\\/))(\[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\_\]+)`

1. `(?:https?:\/\/)?`: This is a non-capturing group `(?: ... )` that matches the protocol part of the URL. It allows for an optional "http://" or "https://", making the URL scheme optional.

2. `(?:youtu\.be\/|(?:www\.|m\.)?youtube\.com\/(?:watch|v|embed)(?:\.php)?(?:\?.*v=|\/))`: This is a non-capturing group that matches different patterns for YouTube video URLs. It covers variations like `youtu.be/`, `www.youtube.com/watch`, `www.youtube.com/v`, `www.youtube.com/embed`, `m.youtube.com/watch`, `m.youtube.com/v`, `m.youtube.com/embed`. It takes into account the optional presence of `"[www](http://www/)." or "m."`, and it considers different ways the video ID might be included in the URL.

3. `([a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+)`: This is a capturing group that matches the actual video ID. It consists of one or more alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or underscores.

In summary, this regular expression is designed to extract YouTube video IDs from various YouTube video URL formats. It is flexible enough to handle different URL variations, making it useful for extracting video IDs from YouTube links in different contexts.
